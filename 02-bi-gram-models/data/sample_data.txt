Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish. He gave an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation. The man seems hardly human. Something troglodytic, shall we say. The mere presence of the man inspired a disgust, loathing, and fear.

There is something wrong with his appearance; something displeasing, something downright detestable. I never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why.

He must be deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I couldn't specify the point. He's an extraordinary-looking man, and yet I really can name nothing out of the way.

The air was thick with danger and dread. Danger lingered like a shadow across the narrow alley. He knew that danger followed wherever Hyde walked.
